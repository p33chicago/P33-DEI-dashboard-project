# Tech Equity Index

A website to analyze the equality - or lack thereof - that exists among underrepresented communities in the tech sector.

Features of the website:

* üì±üñ• Cross-platform: mobile-first, responsive design
* üèé‚ö°Ô∏è Fast: no large JavaScript files to download, served from edge CDN, statically rendering for server, inlined assets, client-side rendering after initial page view
* üîçüßè Accessible: can be used without JavaScript, keyboard navigation, high-contrast
* üë©‚Äçüíª Developer-friendly: [click here to open editor in browser], [technical documentation](./docs/architecture.md), intuitive design system (Tailwind), [commit hooks](./githooks/INSTALLATION.md), web component and accessibility tools enabled out-of-the-box.


This repository consists of two projects:

* [p33py](./p33py/): Python package for processing data to generate visualizations and JSON
* [web](./web/): website which takes visualizations and JSON as input and outputs the website as static HTML.

Technologies used:

* [Plotly for Python] and [Plotly.js]
* [Jupyter] for working with visualizations
* [SvelteKit] web framework
* [TailwindCSS] CSS framework
* [Svelte inspector] to find sourcecode for DOM elements
* [Tota11y] to check accessibility
* [Playwright] browser functional testing
* [Gitpod] cloud IDE
* [Github Pages] hosting
* [Github Actions] pipeline
* [Cloudflare] edge CDN, security
* Commit hooks for linting: [pre-commit], [Black], [Prettier], and [eslint]


## Getting started

See [Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) for more info.

There are two ways of getting a development environment:

1. Using the cloud-based development workspace, Gitpod (recommended)
2. Installing things to your local machine (for advanced users)

See the sections below for more info.


## Cloud-based development environment (Gitpod)

To launch the development workspace in your browser, visit the project's Github page and click the "Contribute with Gitpod" badge.

> Tip: browser keyboard shortcuts can interfere with VSCode's shortcuts. To avoid this, launch the workspace as its own application window. In Chrome, [create a shortcut] via Menu > More Tools > Create Shortcut ...


## Local development environment

‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION ‚ö†Ô∏è:Ô∏è If you use this approach, please be sure you have the proper safetynets - install the [githooks](./githooks/)!.

It's not practical to document everything needed for local development. As an alternative, you can clone the git repo, then look at .gitpod.yml to see what Gitpod does to create a workspace. See [Gitpod's documentation] for details.

Regardless, here are some important points:

* Install githooks
* If a pre-commit hook fails, understand why (there's a reason)
* Use [install.sh](./scripts/install.sh) and [start_dev.sh](./scripts/start_dev.sh) :)


## Notable folders

* [p33py](./p33py/) - Python codebase
* [web](./web/) - web codebase
* [notebooks](./notebooks/) - Jupyter notebooks
* [.github](./.github/) - pipeline
* [githooks](./githooks/) - commit hooks
